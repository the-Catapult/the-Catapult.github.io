# The Marriage That Almost Didn’t Happen

January 10, 2001, was the fateful day on which my marriage was fixed. The venue of the marriage was the holy city of **Varanasi**, situated between the two tributaries of Ganga named Varuna and Assi. Thus, the name “Varanasi” *(Varuna + Assi = Varanasi)* for the city. The year 2001 had a great significance for Hindus as it was the year of **Maha Kumbh Mela**, considered to be the most auspicious in the last 144 years. That year, it was held in **Allahabad** (present-day Prayagraj), where the three holy rivers—**Ganga**, **Yamuna**, and the mythical **Saraswati**—meet at the holy **Sangam** (Confluence). A holy dip at the Sangam during the Kumbh Mela is believed to wash away all sins and provide salvation.

## Varanasi: A City of Spiritual Significance

Varanasi, also known as **Kashi** and **Benaras**, is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, likely due to its location on the banks of the holy river Ganga. Most ancient civilizations have flourished on the banks of rivers as fresh water is essential for survival. This ancient city boasts magnificent architecture and stories of destruction and revival. 

Varanasi is said to be protected by **Mahadev**, the God of Gods. According to local folklore, Mahadev is called “The Kotwal (Police) of Kashi,” ensuring nothing goes wrong in the city. Kashi is also one of the four major **dhams** (pilgrimage sites) in Hinduism. A devout Hindu aspires to visit all four dhams during their lifetime to attain **moksha** (salvation) and freedom from the cycle of rebirth.

While the Maha Kumbh Mela was held in Allahabad, just 131 km away, the influx of visitors to Varanasi was immense. Pilgrims used this opportunity to visit Kashi and fulfill their religious obligations. Varanasi is also significant to **Buddhists** (Sarnath, the famous Buddhist shrine, is here) and **Jains** (a Tirthankar was born here). Its 365 ghats along the Ganga are a major tourist attraction, and the evening **Ganga Aarti**, with chants of *“Har Har Gange”* and *“Har Har Mahadev”*, is a mesmerizing experience. 

It is believed that one who dies in Kashi attains heaven. Many elderly and terminally ill individuals wish to breathe their last here, and the last rites of the deceased are performed at the famous **Harishchandra Ghat** on the banks of the Ganga.

## The Wedding Journey

Let me introduce myself geographically: I was born and brought up in **Chennai**, the capital of Tamil Nadu, known for its hot and humid climate. Winter clothing is practically non-existent here, and anyone wearing a sweater is assumed to be unwell. 

Fate, however, had other plans for me, as my marriage was to take place in **Varanasi**, a North Indian city known for its cold winters. Since my mother-in-law was very sick, the groom’s family requested us to travel to Varanasi for the wedding instead of them coming to Chennai. Being simple and accommodating, we agreed, unaware of what awaited us.

### The Train Journey

Few relatives were willing to travel the long distance by train, so only close family members boarded the **Ganga Cauvery Express**. The journey was enjoyable until **Nagpur**, where the weather suddenly became bitterly cold. Despite being warned about the climate, most relatives carried only one sweater and shawl each, thinking it would suffice. However, the freezing wind seeping through the Sleeper Class coach windows quickly proved them wrong.

At **Itarsi**, Madhya Pradesh, hundreds of unauthorized passengers carrying large vessels boarded the train, filling every available space. Despite our protests, they didn’t budge, as they were headed to Allahabad for the Maha Kumbh Mela to set up food stalls. The overcrowding and discomfort dampened everyone’s spirits. Finally, at Allahabad station, the crowd disembarked, providing much-needed relief. 

After a long, cold journey, we reached a foggy, misty, and freezing **Varanasi** on January 8, 2001.

## Pre-Wedding Challenges

We stayed in a lodge in **Dalmandi**, a bustling market in the heart of Varanasi. The location proved advantageous, as it allowed my relatives to buy extra winter clothing to cope with the biting cold. However, another issue arose: **the nath (nose ornament)**. 

In a Muslim wedding, it is mandatory for the bride to wear a nath. Being South Indian, my nose was pierced on the **right side**, while in North India, it is traditionally pierced on the **left**. This mismatch meant the nath would appear flipped and could make me a laughingstock. With little time to spare, we found a goldsmith in the market who altered the nath to fit the right side. This minor miracle was a huge relief!

## The Wedding Day: A Series of Mishaps

### The Venue

The wedding was scheduled at 11 am at **Aashirwaad Vatika**, a spacious marriage hall. The morning ceremony was planned thoughtfully to avoid the extreme evening cold. However, as the saying goes, “Man proposes, God disposes.”

Decorations and preparations were in full swing, guests began arriving, and the **maulana** who was to conduct the rituals reached on time. But as the clock ticked closer to 11 am, there was no sign of the bride’s family. Panic set in among my in-laws, as we had left the lodge at 7 am and should have reached the venue by 9 am at the latest.

### The Missing Bride

What caused the delay? A sequence of misfortunes. That morning, the **Tempo (a shared auto-rickshaw)**, our chosen mode of transport, failed to show up. Instead, we hired **cycle rickshaws**, which are slower and impractical for transporting large groups. Additionally, the foggy weather and unfamiliarity with Varanasi’s narrow lanes added to the confusion. By the time we arrived, it was almost 1 pm—two hours past the scheduled time.

My in-laws, understandably upset, thought we might have backed out of the marriage. However, their fears were quelled when we arrived and apologized profusely. Despite the mishap, everyone agreed to proceed with the ceremony.

## Post-Wedding Events

### The Reception

After the wedding rituals, a grand reception was arranged that evening. The venue was beautifully decorated, and the food—an elaborate spread of North Indian delicacies—was a highlight. Many relatives who couldn’t make it to the wedding were present at the reception, showering blessings and gifts on the newlyweds.

### The Return Journey

The next day, we boarded the train back to Chennai. This time, we were better prepared for the cold, with warm shawls and blankets purchased in Varanasi. The journey was peaceful, and by the time we arrived in Chennai, everyone was grateful for the memorable yet challenging experience.

## Reflections

Though the marriage journey was fraught with unexpected obstacles—from overcrowded trains to biting cold and delays—it brought out the resilience and adaptability of everyone involved. The mishaps, while stressful at the time, became cherished memories that we now recount with humor and fondness. 

The marriage that almost didn’t happen turned out to be the start of a beautiful new chapter in our lives. And for me, the experience was a profound reminder of how love, patience, and a bit of good fortune can overcome any obstacle.
