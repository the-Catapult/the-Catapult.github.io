*Once upon a time, we were so poor...*

It’s the wedding season again. DJs, *nagadas*, bands, *baaja*, and *baraats* fill the air with festivity. I attend lavish functions, dressed in my finest attire, adorned with matching accessories—even my footwear is chosen with care. Nothing is amiss; everything meets the so-called social standards. I can afford to give expensive gifts now.

But there was a time when things were different. Some childhood memories are so strongly etched in our minds that the slightest trigger brings them rushing back. This wedding season has triggered one such memory—one that takes me back to a time when even a crisp ten-rupee note was a luxury.

**A Friendship and a Wedding Invitation**

Back then, a Bengali family lived next door. They had three daughters and a son, all much older than me—except for the youngest girl. She and I became inseparable friends. Every morning, we walked together to a nearby village to buy fresh milk, chattering endlessly about everything and nothing. Those were carefree days, filled with laughter and girlish giggles.

She was a brilliant student, and when she moved to a prestigious college in Karnataka, I missed her terribly. During her holidays, she would return, transformed—wiser, more knowledgeable, and full of stories. I admired her immensely. It was from her that I first learned about *M&B novels* and the universal fantasy of a *tall, dark, and handsome* hero.

One day, she excitedly informed me that her elder sister was getting married. She insisted that I *must* attend the wedding. I was thrilled! But my mother’s refusal struck like a thunderbolt.

**A Silent Struggle**

She wouldn’t give me a reason. I threw tantrums, cried, begged—what would my friend think if I didn’t attend? But my mother stood firm.

On the wedding day, my friend came one last time to invite me and my family. My mother was now caught in a *dharma sankat*—it would look terrible if none of us attended. Reluctantly, she allowed me to go.

Excited, I rummaged through my clothes—back then, the choices were few, unlike my overflowing wardrobe today. Dressing up wasn’t the issue. The real problem lurked elsewhere—what gift would I give?

Those days, people usually gifted money at weddings. I turned to my mother for it. And there it was—the real reason for her refusal.

We had *no money*.

Not even a hundred rupees in the house. No bank accounts to withdraw from. Every rupee my parents earned was spent on education, food, and necessities. I was too young to understand our struggles.

Tears welled up. I howled again. My mother frantically searched her masala tins—sometimes, she hid money in them for emergencies. But that day, every tin came up empty. I was furious. Why didn’t she have money?

Her irritated reply stung:

*"Your father is not a Tata-Birla."*

(Ambani wasn’t the benchmark of wealth back then, or she would have surely added his name too!)

**The Soiled Notes and a Brother’s Solution**

Left with no choice, my mother turned to our neighbors. The old tobacco-chewing lady next door opened her *surukku pai*—a small cloth pouch—and handed over a crumpled ten-rupee note that reeked of tobacco. *Yuck!* Today, I wouldn’t even touch such a note. But that day, money mattered more than its condition.

Another neighbor contributed a five-rupee note, two two-rupee notes, and a one-rupee note. My mother scraped together a final rupee.

Total: 21 rupees.

But when my mother handed me the money, I looked at it in disgust. *Soiled, crumpled, embarrassing.*

The crying began again.

I don’t remember where my father was that day, but my elder brother was home. My mother called him in to deal with me. Though a loving brother, he relished the authority given to him in such moments. Once, he even slapped me on my *birthday* for refusing to change out of my school uniform! His logic? *"You’ll remember this and never repeat the mistake."* (Well, he was right—I still remember!)

That day, in his usual problem-solving manner, he asked me:

*"Is your issue the amount or the dirty notes?"*

"Both!" I sulked.

Calmly, he said, *"I can’t increase the amount, but I can fix the notes."*

What he did next remains unforgettable.

**A Currency’s Baptism**

My brother *washed* the notes with *soap and water*!  

Yes, you read that right.

Our neighbors, my mother, and I stood around, watching in disbelief. My eyes were wide with terror—*what if the notes tore?!*

But my brother was careful. The notes, though cleaner, were still crumpled. So, he went a step further—he ironed them!

The transformation was astonishing. The old, crumpled notes now looked *somewhat* presentable. Probably, currency held by the poor is resilient—like its owners.

The money was placed in an envelope and handed to me. But I was still dissatisfied. The *one-rupee* and *two-rupee* notes felt shamefully small.

*"Can’t we exchange these for a single 10-rupee note?"* I pleaded.

That was the final straw. My mother and brother had had enough. *"Take it or don’t go!"*

**A Gift and a Silent Goodbye**

With a heavy heart, I went to the wedding. But I couldn’t enjoy the food, the music, or the celebrations. My mind remained fixated on the *ugly* notes I was clutching.

At the reception counter, I silently slipped the envelope in—without writing my name. I avoided my friend, fearing she would recognize the modest gift and mock it.

But today, I no longer feel ashamed.

That moment, that struggle, that *ten-rupee note washed and ironed with love*—all of it shaped who I am. And every wedding season, this memory returns, reminding me of a time when wealth was measured not by what we owned, but by how hard we fought to give—even when we had nothing.

*Yes, once upon a time, we were so poor...*
