In my 50s now, life’s a blend,  
And I’ve found joy in my new friends.  
Not just colleagues or mates from the past,  
But companions born of a bond that lasts.  

They’re Gen Z, tech-savvy and swift,  
Guiding me through this modern drift.  
Gadgets, apps, and lingo galore,  
They teach me wonders, I learn and adore.  

I bring to them my stories and years,  
Lessons of triumph, laughter, and tears.  
A jolly good woman, bold and spry,  
With curiosity that never runs dry.  

Sometimes my boldness makes them squirm,  
Audacious in public, on a whim I turn.  
But they know me well, they laugh it away,  
For together, we brighten any day.  

How time flies when we sit and chat,  
Sharing thoughts, on this and that.  
Midnight comes, and still, we talk,  
Reluctant to let the hours unlock.  

These friends of mine, my greatest treasure,  
Bring joy and love beyond all measure.  
For when your best friends are your own kids,  
Life is a gift that the heart never bids.  

I feel blessed, as any mother could,  
With two gems of my flesh and blood.  
Their laughter, their love, their light so bright,  
Make every day feel just right.
