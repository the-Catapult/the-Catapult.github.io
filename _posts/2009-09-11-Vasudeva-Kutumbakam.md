title: "Vasudeva Kutumbakam: A Dream of One World, One Family"
author: Waheeda Khan

During my posting in Delhi, one of my senior officers often spoke about **"Vasudeva Kutumbakam,"** a Sanskrit phrase that translates to **"The whole world is one family."** For the tech-savvy younger generation, it aligns with what they term as **globalization.**  

Over the past few months, I’ve been reflecting deeply on this thought. **Is it truly possible for the whole world to function as one family?** Imagine a world with no countries, no borders, no divisions of caste, creed, religion, or race. All nations standing united, practicing only one religion: **Humanity.**  

In this vision, wealthy countries would extend a helping hand to their less fortunate brethren, fostering equality and eliminating poverty. Strife and war would cease to exist. Man-made suffering would become a relic of the past. **Peace and bliss would prevail everywhere.** Such a world would no longer be called Earth—it would be **Heaven.**  

But then, I wonder—**would such a utopian world become monotonous?** Without differences and competition, would the spirit to excel and achieve still thrive? Would we still enjoy the electrifying excitement of an **India-Pakistan cricket match** or the adrenaline rush of the **FIFA World Cup?** What about the **Olympics?** Would athletes feel the same joy in victory when their *opponents* are no longer rivals but members of a global family? Would scientists remain as ambitious to **innovate and discover** in a world devoid of challenges?  

Without vices, how would we truly value virtues? After all, **it is often through struggle and adversity that greatness emerges.**  

From a philosophical perspective, they say **Adam and Eve,** on Eve’s insistence, plucked the **forbidden apple,** leading to their expulsion from **Heaven.** This marked the beginning of humanity’s journey on Earth—a place inherently defined by **struggle and strife.**  

Perhaps **Vasudeva Kutumbakam** will remain a **beautiful yet hypothetical ideal.** A vision that inspires **hope,** but one that the **inherent complexities of human nature** might never fully allow.
