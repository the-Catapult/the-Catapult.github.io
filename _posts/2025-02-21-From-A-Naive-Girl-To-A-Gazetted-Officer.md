title: From a Naive Girl to a Gazetted Officer

On **21st February 1990**, a dark, thin, almost spiny girl arrived at **Group Centre, CRPF, Pallipuram**, with her father. She had come to join the prestigious organization called **CRPF** as an **Assistant Sub-Inspector** in the **Ministerial Cadre**.

She was still in college when she received the offer of appointment. The letter stated that she could join the **Pallipuram office** no later than **21st February 1990**. She was about to enter her third year of college and faced a tough choice: complete her graduation and forgo the job or seize the government job offer and complete her education later through correspondence courses.

After much discussion with family and friends, the decision was made—she would take the job. So, on the last date of joining, she stood at **GC, CRPF, Pallipuram** with her father and a suitcase filled with clothes and a few essential items lovingly packed by her mother.

She had never stepped into an office before, except for those in her school and college. She had no idea what was expected of her. This was her first job, her first experience of an office atmosphere. Naturally, when she saw men her father's age, she addressed them as **"Uncle,"** as was common in the society where she grew up. But soon, she was corrected—*“In office, nobody is ‘Uncle’ or ‘Aunty.’ They are all ‘Sir’ and ‘Madam,’ even if it is your own mother or father under whom you are working.”*

Her father stayed with her for two days, ensuring she was comfortably accommodated in the **Subordinate Officers’ Annexe** with three other newly appointed girls. Then, it was time for him to leave. As he bid her farewell, he told her to be **brave, strong, and to work sincerely** under the guidance of her seniors. Before leaving, he made a promise—he would **write her a letter every single day**. And this promise he kept until his last breath.

She was an *active girl but also naive*—both about office procedures and the ways of the world. When someone called her in the office, she would *run to them*, just as she did when teachers summoned her in school or college! She didn’t know that she was now a *working woman* and was expected to *walk more modestly*.

For the first time, she heard the term **"office decorum."** It was often used when referring to the new entrants—“They should maintain office decorum!” But what in the name of heaven was this **"office decorum"**? There was no **Google** in those days to look up meanings of such phrases. One had to rely entirely on **seniors for guidance**.

As a newly appointed assistant, she was placed under the **supervision of a senior official**. If one was lucky, they got a *patient and kind mentor* who taught them work without scolding them for mistakes. Otherwise, mistakes could mean *public humiliation* in the office.

Fortunately, she was posted under **Vasanthakumari Madam**, a **knowledgeable and kind-hearted senior lady official**. **Vasanthakumari Madam** not only taught her the **responsibilities of a Pay Clerk** but also guided her in *office mannerisms*. She explained that she need not **stand up for the high-handed peon, Ravi**, who came to distribute **dak (official correspondence)**. Ravi was **loud, grumbling about new entrants** as if he were their senior! She had assumed he was an officer and would stand up every time he approached her table—**phew!**

Though she **missed home**—her parents’ love, her siblings, and most of all, her **mother’s cooking**—she gradually adjusted to her new environment. At home, she had often complained about eating the **same regular dishes**, but now, away from home, she **longed for those very same meals**!

Her **father’s daily letters** were her greatest solace. She eagerly waited for the **postman**, the only person in the office who received letters every single day was her! During **postal strikes**, she would receive **10-15 letters together**, one for each day the strike had lasted.

Her journey in **CRPF**, which began in **Kerala**, took her across the country, with **transfers every 3-4 years**. Over time, she grew—not just in years but in **wisdom**. The young, inexperienced girl who had joined the **Force** soon transformed into a **professionally competent working woman**.

**Marriage and children followed.** Professionally, she climbed the ranks, earning **promotions at the right time**. Today, she stands as a **proud Group A Gazetted Officer** of the **largest paramilitary force in the world**.

As she looks at today’s date—**21st February 2025**—she realizes that she has spent **35 long years** in this Force.

A journey of **dedication**.  
A journey of **learning**.  
A journey of **commitment** to this **great organization** called **CRPF**.
