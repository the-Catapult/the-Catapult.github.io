No matter what fate brought in its stride,  
No matter what Life kept aside or did hide,  

I found in him a friend for a lifetime,  
A bond that couldn’t be broken anytime.  

He was my first childhood hero,  
He solved all my problems like a pro,  
Not that we never had any fights,  
But the bonding of love was tight.  
He could never win over me with my dad around,  
But he too got back at me through his mom’s hand.  

All those childhood memories I still cherish,  
The adventures and games we played were sheer bliss,  
I was always in his team no matter what,  
His friends had to always tolerate this fussy little brat!  

But as time flew and up we grew,  
Life unrolled a different way and  
Destiny took us in its own sway.  
Yet, no matter how far or near I stayed,  
He was there always, just a call away albeit.  
In joy and sorrow, loss and gain,  
He eased my heart, he shared my pain.  
No matter how tired or forlorn,  
He never let this little brat down!  
Silently extending help in different ways,  
Subtlety a trademark of his inimitable grace.  

As the world celebrates Valentine's Day today,  
A day that pays tribute to unending love's sway,  
Memories keep flooding my heart,  
Of the one and only childhood braveheart!  

We were destined to be siblings,  
That's the best gift I got as an offspring.  
So now that you know about whom I'm speaking,  
Yes, this is a tribute for my brother & friend.  
Years may pass, and paths may bend,  
But he'll for sure be my best friend.  
He will for sure be my best friend...  

**Happy Valentine's Day!!**
