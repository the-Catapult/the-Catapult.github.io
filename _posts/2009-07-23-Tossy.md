Last year, someone brought a small black-and-white puppy to our home for my daughter to play with. It was not a high-quality breed, just the pup of an ordinary stray dog.

At first, I did not want it—because pets are responsibilities. I believe that once you take up the responsibility of raising a pet, you should discharge your duty sincerely and treat them like a family member. But with my busy schedule, it was not possible. I already had two naughty brats at home, and now an additional brat? No way…

Alas, I had to give in to my daughter's heart-rending pleas. You know how little girls are—it’s so difficult to break their hearts. I conceded defeat, and the pup came to stay with us.

My daughter named him Tossy, and he became the newest addition to our family. Tossy, a very naughty puppy full of life, became the center of attraction for my children, who loved playing with him.

After about a fortnight, one of my uncles visited us. Upon seeing the pup, he remarked, “Why are you keeping a stray dog in your house? And that too, a bitch?”

It was only then that we realized Tossy was a female, not a male!

### Tossy's Troubles Begin

My 65-year-old mother, who was totally against having a pet dog at home, was even more displeased upon discovering that Tossy was a female. She decided to get rid of her, believing that a stray dog could survive anywhere. India is full of such stray dogs, she reasoned.

Besides, Tossy had started creating all sorts of problems. She would hide our slippers, run away with the kids' toys and stash them away, and chew off my daughter’s favorite Barbie doll's head—sometimes, my son would even give the doll to Tossy deliberately just to irritate his sister! The house was in constant chaos.

One day, my mother, who already suffered from high blood pressure, lost her patience. While the children were at school and I was at work, she called the maid’s grandson, put Tossy in a bag, and handed her over to him, instructing him to abandon her far away. The boy did as he was told.

For two days, Tossy was gone.

Our home suddenly felt eerily silent. My daughter cried her heart out, convinced that someone had kidnapped her Tossy. I knew the truth but dared not tell her. I was torn between my feelings as a mother and as a daughter.

### Tossy's Return

On the third day, while taking my daughter to school on my Scooty, she suddenly spotted Tossy in the marketplace. She started shouting excitedly:

"Tossy! Tossy!"

Tossy recognized the sound of our vehicle, saw us, and started running behind us. When we reached the school, before my daughter could enter the gate, Tossy ran ahead and leaped up in joy upon seeing her.

I wanted to stop Tossy, but I couldn’t. The sight of so many children excited her, and she ran all over the school campus. I asked my daughter to go to her class and promised that I would take Tossy home.

Reluctantly, she obeyed.

However, before I could get hold of Tossy, the school bell rang, and I had to leave. Tossy was nowhere to be found.

That afternoon, when I went to pick up my daughter from school, I waited patiently—but she was nowhere to be seen. The school premises were slowly emptying, yet there was no sign of her.

Suddenly, I noticed a group of children huddled together, walking towards me. Their heads were all focused on something in the middle of their circle. Curious, I walked towards them.

And then, I saw it—my daughter, standing in the center, her school uniform completely soiled, clutching Tossy tightly in her arms!

The children excitedly began narrating how Tossy had entered their classroom, run from one class to another, and caused complete chaos in the school. The headmistress had reprimanded my daughter, warning her never to bring a dog to school.

(It all sounds like a very bookish story, doesn’t it? But it’s true. This is exactly what happened, and I am writing it as it was.)

Tossy had waited outside the school building the entire day. When school was over, my daughter and her friends searched for her and found her.

Thus, Tossy came back to our home once again—much to my mother’s annoyance.

### Tossy Grows Up

Tossy grew up fast. We called the vet, got her vaccinated, and she blossomed into a healthy dog.

Within eight months, she had attained puberty! Now, a host of male suitors began gathering outside our compound walls. It was mating season, and somehow, the male dogs instinctively sensed the presence of an unpaired female nearby. No matter how much we shooed them away, they refused to budge.

My mother, now more exasperated than ever, would sit with a big stick to drive them off. One day, irritated beyond measure, she remarked:

"Even when my two daughters attained puberty, I didn’t have to keep vigil over them! But for this bitch, here I am, standing guard!"

But for how long could we keep Tossy confined? She, too, wanted to go out and mate—it was the call of nature.

And so, our Tossy got pregnant.

### Tossy Becomes a Mother

All the male suitors who had once relentlessly pursued her were nowhere to be seen. Now that she was pregnant and suffering from morning sickness, they had all disappeared.

(Thank God, such things are rare in human relationships…)

Surprisingly, it was my mother who took the best care of Tossy now. She fed her well and showed her sympathy for the first time.

Soon, the big day arrived—Tossy delivered five puppies. Unfortunately, two didn’t survive, but the remaining three grew up well.

Two of them were females (no mistake this time!) and one was a male. We named them:

- Julie
- Barbie
- Umangasaur (named after an alien from my son's favorite TV show, Ben 10!)

And so, our family grew even larger, with Tossy and her little ones becoming an inseparable part of our lives.
