It was raining heavily that day in Panchgani. This famous tourist spot on the Deccan Plateau receives very heavy rainfall during the monsoon season. Eighteen-year-old Salim lived here with his uncle’s family. Panchgani has some of the best boarding schools in India, and most of the rich and affluent families from Mumbai and Pune enroll their children in these prestigious institutions. Getting admission into these schools was tough, as seats were limited and the demand skyrocketed. Studying at one of these schools was a matter of great privilege.

Salim was lucky to have had the opportunity to reside with his uncle’s family and complete his early schooling from this paradise of lush green trees, valleys, and hills. The place is aptly known as the Switzerland of Maharashtra! After completing his schooling in this picturesque and enthralling place, Salim was now pursuing his graduation from a college in Wai, near Panchgani. The daily journey to college, passing the beautiful Krishna River and its valley, was also a memorable experience for him.

Salim’s uncle, Nissar, who had an M.Sc. and M.Ed. in Mathematics, was a school teacher at one of Panchgani’s reputed boarding schools. He was a sought-after teacher, as he taught one of the most challenging subjects—Mathematics. The family consisted of his uncle, his aunt Sameera, and their three sons. Salim, the son of Nissar’s elder brother, was treated like family, and his uncle and aunt never differentiated between him and their own children.

Salim always felt grateful to his uncle and aunt for accommodating him in their family and providing him the opportunity to receive quality education in this beautiful place, which was surrounded by five hills of the Western Ghats (Sahyadri mountain range). This is how the place got its name—"Panch" means five, and "gani" means hills. He loved Panchgani so much that whenever he went back to his parents’ home in Uttar Pradesh during the long summer holidays, he longed to return to this land of strawberries. Yes, Panchgani and Mahabaleshwar are two hill stations in Maharashtra famous for their strawberry farming.

Salim usually traveled back to Panchgani from Mumbai in a State Road Transport Bus. As the bus neared the hills, the cool, fresh breeze with the mesmerizing aroma of strawberries seemed to welcome him back. He was a strawberry fan and loved all strawberry products—jams, pulps, spreads, juices, et al.

## A Stormy Night

That night, the downpour was relentless. His aunt served an early dinner to all the children and asked them to go to bed early. As they lay in bed, waiting for sleep to engulf them, they could hear the rainwater gushing down the hilly slopes. It was a bit terrifying. As if to compound their fears, they suddenly heard their aunt shriek, calling out to Salim and his cousins.

All of them ran to her room to find out what had happened. There, they saw Uncle Nissar lying on the bed in his pajamas and vest, breathless and complaining of chest pain. Their aunt, in tears, pleaded with Salim to take him to a hospital immediately. Salim tried to reassure her, suggesting it could be gastritis, as his uncle often suffered from it. But no one wanted to take a risk. What if it was something more serious?

They decided to shift Uncle Nissar to the nearby nursing home, but in such heavy rain, they doubted whether they could get a taxi. It was the 1980s—technology and transport services were not as advanced as they are today. There were no mobile phones, nor were there Ola or Uber services. Although his uncle’s family knew some local taxi drivers, someone had to go to the taxi stand to fetch one.

Being the eldest among the brothers, Salim took the responsibility upon himself. He tried to kick-start his motorcycle, which was having trouble due to the cold and wet weather. After several attempts, the engine finally roared to life. With a sigh of relief, he left for the taxi stand in the heavy rain.

## The Mysterious Presence

The rain was so heavy that it fell like a thick sheet, making visibility difficult. As he rode, Salim felt an eerie sensation—like someone was following him. He turned back but saw no one. Still, the feeling lingered. Dismissing it as his imagination, he focused on reaching the taxi stand.

Luckily, he found a familiar taxi driver, who, despite the heavy downpour, agreed to take the risk, understanding the medical emergency. As the taxi drove ahead, Salim followed on his motorcycle. But again, he felt it—that something was following him. Whenever he stopped, he felt it stop. When he sped up, it seemed to accelerate too.

His aunt often told them ghost stories when they refused to sleep at night. Panchgani had many abandoned colonial-era bungalows, some dating back to the British era. Tales of ghosts lurking in those old houses circulated among the locals. Salim had never believed in such things, but now, as he rode through the storm, a shiver ran down his spine.

Soon, he reached home, fetched his uncle, and helped him into the taxi. His aunt and cousin accompanied them to the hospital, while Salim once again followed the taxi on his motorcycle—still sensing it behind him. He tried to recall the Aayatul Kursi (a Quranic verse believed to ward off evil spirits). In his stressful state, he could remember only the first two lines, which he kept repeating as he rode.

## The Revelation

At the hospital, the doctors confirmed that it was not a heart attack but just a severe case of gastritis. Uncle Nissar was advised to avoid oily, greasy, and spicy foods—a challenge, given his love for rich dishes! After a few days, he was discharged.

As they stepped out of the hospital, a black dog suddenly ran toward them from the bushes, wagging its tail and jumping excitedly at Uncle Nissar. The hospital watchman tried to shoo it away, assuming it was a stray.

> “Is this your dog?” he asked.

Salim and his family exchanged glances. It wasn’t exactly their dog, but it was a familiar one. Their youngest cousin had named him Jimmy, and though they never officially adopted him, he lived near their house. Uncle Nissar, who hated wasting food, made it a point to feed Jimmy the leftover food every day.

The watchman told them that the dog had arrived at the hospital in the pouring rain the previous night. It had tried multiple times to enter the hospital premises, causing trouble for him. That’s when everything clicked for Salim—Jimmy had followed him all along!

The eerie presence he had felt in the rain, the thing that had matched his every move—it was none other than Jimmy, silently ensuring his safety. The dog had risked the heavy downpour, stayed near the hospital all night, and now, seeing his caretaker safe, had rushed to express his joy.

Salim was deeply moved. The family had hesitated to claim Jimmy as theirs, but the dog had never hesitated to claim them as his own.

> In a world where loyalty is often transactional, Jimmy was a shining example of true love and gratitude personified.

As they headed home, hiring another taxi, Salim rode ahead on his motorcycle. And this time, leading the way in the forefront, with unwavering devotion, was **Jimmy!**
