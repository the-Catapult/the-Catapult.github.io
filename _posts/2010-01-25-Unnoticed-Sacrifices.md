This happened just yesterday. It was a relaxed Sunday, and my 4-year-old son and I were leisurely watching TV. He absolutely loves watching the ads, and I can't change the channel during commercial breaks, as he would start shrieking in protest. So, I've gotten into the habit of watching all the ads with him these days.  

One ad that recently caught our attention featured **Sachin Tendulkar**—our iconic cricketer, who really needs no introduction—promoting **Sunfeast Dream Cream Biscuits**. The ad promises that a lucky buyer of the biscuits could win the chance to meet Sachin.  

Excitedly, I turned to my son and said:  

> *"Come on, let’s buy this biscuit, and if you're lucky, you might get to meet Sachin! He's such a great cricketer."*  

But do you know what my son said?  

He looked at me with innocent eyes and said:  

> **"I don't want to meet Sachin. I want to meet my dad. Is there a biscuit that can bring him back?"**  

I was stunned, and tears welled up in my eyes as I realized how much my son was missing his father, who is deployed in Kashmir for law and order duties as part of the Forces.  

Sachin might be a hero to millions, but for my son, it’s his dad who is the true hero—elusive and yet infinitely special. ❤️
